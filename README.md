# Hackbio_Internship-
**Stage 1**: Welcome and programming basics [Easing In]
This stage is to help participants ease into the program, integrate with their team and people, take their time to learn and build their confidence in bioinformatics. In this phase, you will learn how to program in BASh. Here are the instructions for this stage
Attend the Onboarding call
Join the slack workspace
Edit your profile üòÄ(optional)
Edit your display name to a single alphanumeric word (no spaces.
Set your status to ‚ÄúStage 1 1Ô∏è‚É£‚Äù
Calm down and wait for instructions 
Important: Always stay on the #announcement for latest updates, instructions and information from the internship

**Stage 2:** Mastering the Basics
Here, you will build a fully functional NGS data analysis pipeline that can handle any given NGS dataset and spit out the mutations in the dataset. This is the foundation of genomics. It has a little bit of software and data engineering components but we provide enough resources to help you solve them. You will write everything in BASh. You will use this pipeline at later stages in the internship, so make sure it works well on any dataset or device/system.
Everything in this stage will be fully tested for speed, accuracy and reproducibility. We prioritize more on reproducibility and accuracy over speed. Also, at the end of this stage, someone in your team should be selected randomly to present your pipeline and how it works.

**Stage 3:** First Project
This is the first CV worthy project you will do. We should also inform you that you will have to split your team into 2; the technical people that will work on the coding side of the projects; and the communications part that will work on writing a technical report as well as a short video describing what you did in simple language. 
Note, there is no reshuffling of teams here, only transfer of people if your team has lost too many people.

**Stage 4:** Second Project
This is the last stage. Congratulations!!! This is another CV worthy project that will help you utilize your genomic skills to solve important diseases. We will provide datasets for 1 cancer subtype, plant disease, neurodegenerative disorder and lifestyle related disorder. At this stage, if you also have a project idea, it is also welcome and you can convince your teammates to solve it together. Nevertheless, we also provide project ideas in the LMS. Just pick one and solve it. 
Also, you should have a technical and a communications team just like the last stage.
